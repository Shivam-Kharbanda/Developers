## 🧩 Problem Statement

The current website of UIET (University Institute of Engineering and Technology) lacks modern design standards, optimal performance, and accessibility compliance. Users face difficulties due to outdated UI, slow load times, and poor responsiveness across devices.

- Modernize its visual and functional design.
- Enhance usability for students, faculty, and visitors.
- Apply real-world web development practices to deliver a professional-grade product.
- Provide a scalable and maintainable website that reflects the academic and research excellence of UIET.
